Ilmarinen:
	 Sampo is providing people of Pohjola phenomenal wealth!
	That artifact was my creation - born from my sweat, skill, and magic! 
Väinämöinen:
	 Artifact born from extortion! 
	Loviatar would have left me to die, if I hadn't summoned you to her House.
Ilmarinen: 
	And I get nothing from it! Väinölä gets nothing!
	She promised me a wife, but they just used us. Her daughters are both gone now.
Väinämöinen:
	We should rob back what should be ours!
Ilmarinen:
	Yes!
Lemminkäinen:
	You guys are gonna pillage in Pohjola? 
	Count me in. I have a bone to pick with Louhi as well.
