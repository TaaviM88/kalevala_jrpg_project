In aftermath of the battle, Väinämöinen finds something interesting in the remains of the sea beast.
A piece of jawbone that eminates a strange power. 
Maybe it could be used to strenghten his magical abilites of song and music, The Runo, into new heights?

Our heroes continue their journey to Pohjola. To defeat Louhi and get back the Sampo.

Thank you for playing the demo! We'd love to hear back from you!

Hopefully we'll return in the world of Kalevala soon!
